1) Length and breadth of a rectangle are 5 and 7 respectively. Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

CODE:
  public class Rectangle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int len = 7;
        int bre = 5;
        int pere = 2*(len+bre);
        System.out.println(pere);
    }
}

2)Write a program to add 8 to the number 2345 and then divide it by 3. Now, the modulus of the quotient is taken with 5 and then multiply the resultant value by 5. Display the final result.

CODE:
public class Adding {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            int initialNumber = 2345;
            int numberPlus8 = initialNumber + 8;
            int quotient = numberPlus8 / 3;
            int modulusResult = quotient % 5;
            int finalResult = modulusResult * 5;
            System.out.println("The final result is: " + finalResult);
        }
    }
    
3)Write a program to check if the two numbers 23 and 45 are equal.
CODE:
public class Twonumber {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 =23;
        int num2 =43;   
        if(num1==num2)
        {
            System.out.println("Equal");
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("Not equal");
        }
    }

}

4)Write a program to calculate the perimeter of a triangle having sides of length 2,3 and 5 units.
CODE:
public class Perimeter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(2+3+5);
    }
}
 5) If the marks of Robert in three subjects are 78,45 and 62 respectively (each out of 100 ), write a program to calculate his total marks and percentage marks.

CODE:
public class subjects {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sub1=78;
        int sub2=45;
        int sub3=62;
        int total = sub1+sub2+sub3;
        double percentage= (double)total/300*100;
        System.out.println("this is total marks of the student " + total);
        System.out.println("this is total marks of the student" + percentage);
    }
}
